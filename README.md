## Project Specs
1. Give your page a `<title>`
2. Create two `<div>` elements in your page. One for Mac and one for Windows:
    - Create one <div> with id="mac" and one <div> with id="windows"
    - Give each <div> a class of "laptops"
3. For each `<div>` include:
    - `<h1>` tag of your choice to grab the users attention to the Mac or Windows `<div>`
    - Include 3 Images of Mac Laptops or Windows Laptops (depending on your section) and include them within their own `<div>` Elements.
4. Include a `<p>` element under each image describing the image.
5. Include an `<ol>` element of the top 3 laptops (depending on your `<div>`)
6. Include an `<ul>` element with 3 prices of your laptops 
    - These prices could be based on a real product or could be made up
7. Include an <a> tag to Apple's Website or Microsoft Website (depending on the `<div>` youâ€™re working on.)
8. Commit and push your final work back to GitHub
